Dose 5 supports bivalent boosting when 2 doses of monovalent boosting has occurred.\tAt the time bivalent boosters are recommended, patients may have received 0, 1, or 2 monovalent boosters. Regardless of previous monovalent boosters, all patients are recommended a bivalent booster.  - For those who received 2 monovalent boosters, Doses 3 and 4 support evaluation of those doses based on the intervals at that time. - For those who received 1 monovalent booster, Dose 3 will support evaluation of those doses based on the intervals at that time.  - Bivalent boosters are overlayed across Dose 3, 4, and 5. A bivalent will always be forecasted until a bivalent dose is administered. Once a bivalent booster is administered, any subsequent doses are skipped.  This strategy is used for other series as well when a patient could have received monovalent doses.

This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tYes\tStandard\t1\tA\t1\tn/a\t18 years\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t0 days\t6 months\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tStandard\t1\tA\t2\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t18 years\t18 years\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tStandard\t1\tA\t3\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t0 days\t6 months\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Clinical trial participants who did not receive all the recommended doses, or who received other vaccines not listed above, should consult with their healthcare provider to determine if they should receive an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine series.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tStandard\t1\tA\t9\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t18 years - 4 days\t18 years\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t1\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t2\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t3\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t5\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tNo\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t6\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Clinical trial participants who did not receive all the recommended doses, or who received other vaccines not listed above, should consult with their healthcare provider to determine if they should receive an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine series.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA patients clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise and appropriate timing of vaccination.  Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA conversation between the patient, their guardian(s), and their clinical team or a specialist is strongly encouraged to assist with decisions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of MIS-C or MIS-A.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccination does not need to be delayed following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t7\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Doesn't that mean that an individual could complete the Twinrix series without getting any doses of Twinrix?\tYes, a subject matter expert at the CDC confirmed that an individual would be considered fully protected with 3 doses of HepA single antigen vaccine on the Twinrix schedule. Because this schedule is intended for use with Twinrix, we have elected to keep the tradename in the series name.\tn/a\tHepA is allowable for all 3 doses in the Twinrix 3-dose series.\nFAQs\tIn the 2-dose series, the Preferable Interval and Allowable Interval look suspiciously like the same thing, why are both necessary?\tThe Preferable Interval is 6 months from the immediately previous dose which may be invalid if an attempted second dose was administered before 6 months. However the April 2017 ACIP Best Practice Guidelines notes an administration pattern where if the last dose is separated by 6 months from the 1st dose, Hep A can be considered complete. The Allowable Interval accounts for this possibility.\thttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html\tBoth the Preferable and Allowable interval is populated for dose 2 of a 2-dose series.\nFAQs\tIn the Risk 2-dose series why are CVX codes 83 and 104 allowable for the first dose but not the second dose?\tDoses of CVX 83 and 104 contain a lower dose of antigen which is only valid for persons under the age of 19 years. The 2-dose risk series for adults only, but if a patient received one dose before the age of 19 years it still counts towards completion of the first dose of the series. It is expected that the second dose will occur after the age of 19 years (otherwise the patient will have completed the equivalent 2-dose standard series) and so these CVX codes will not be valid.\tn/a\tCVX codes 83 and 104 are only allowable for the first dose.\nFAQs\tHow can the supporting data be used to recommend Hepatitis A to all adults?\tOnce support of risk series is implemented, by assigning an indication of \"Patient seeks protection (001)\" to all individuals of the appropriate age, vaccination against Hepatitis A will be recommended.\tn/a\tn/a\nFAQs\tIs there a minimum interval between the infant travel dose (6 through 11 months) from the Risk 1-dose series and the initial dose of the standard 2-dose series?\tNo, there is no minimum interval between those two doses.\tCDC subject matter experts\tDose 1 of the standard 2-dose series has no minimum interval\n","immunity":"Clinical History Immunity\tImmunity Guideline\nClinical History Immunity\tLaboratory Evidence of Immunity or confirmation of Hepatitis A disease (018)\n\nBirth Date Immunity\tImmunity Birth Date\tImmunity Country of Birth\tImmunity Exclusion Condition\nBirth Date Immunity\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n","contraindications":"Antigen Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nAntigen Contraindication\tAdverse reaction to vaccine component (080)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had an adverse reaction to a vaccine component.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nAntigen Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction after previous dose of Hepatitis A (096)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of Hepatitis A vaccine.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nAntigen Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction to neomycin (107)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction to neomycin.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nAntigen Contraindication\tHypersensitivity to alum (112)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has a hypersensitivity to alum.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nVaccine Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tVaccine Type (CVX)\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nVaccine Contraindication\tHypersensitivity to yeast (110)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has a hypersensitivity to yeast.\tn/a\tHepA-HepB (104)\tn/a\tn/a\n","series":["Series Name\tHepA 2-dose series\nTarget Disease\tHepA\nVaccine Group\tHepA\nAdministrative Guidance\tText\nAdministrative Guidance\tn/a\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tNo\tStandard\t1\tA\t1\tn/a\t19 years\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t12 months - 4 days\t12 months\t12 months\t24 months + 4 weeks\t19 years\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPersons with a history of egg allergy may receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPersons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices). Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tNo\tStandard\t1\tA\t1\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t6 months - 4 days\t6 months\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

If the patient is younger than age 7 years when the primary series is completed, then the first booster dose should be given with a 3 year interval followed by boosters every 5 years afterwards. If the patient is over the age of 7 years when the primary series is completed, then the first booster should be given with a 5 year interval and every 5 years afterwards.\thttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mening.html\tThe second to last dose has an interval of 3 years and Conditional Skip logic that allows the dose to be skipped if the primary series was completed after the age of 7 years. Because only a single booster dose with a 3 year interval is required, this dose is not marked as a Recurring Dose.

For full immunity, vaccination is still required.\thttp://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_pol.asp\tThe immunity tab does not contain any factors which indicate immunity.\nFAQs\tIf a child is older than 4 years, can the all IPV series be reduced to 3 doses?\tThe recommendation is for 4 doses even after 4 years of age unless 6 months have passed since the second dose. At that point, the recommendation would be to reduce the number of doses to 3.\thttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf\tDose 3 of the all IPV series has Conditional Skip logic that allows the dose to be skipped if BOTH a minimum age and minimum interval from dose 2 are achieved.\nFAQs\tIf 4 doses of IPV at appropriate intervals are sufficient, why is there a 5 dose series documented in CDSi?\tBecause some combination vaccines are recommended to be administered at intervals different than the recommendations for IPV alone, it is possible to receive 4 valid doses of an IPV containing vaccine before the age of 4 years and still require a 5th dose after age 4.\thttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5830a3.htm\tThe fourth dose in the 5-dose IPV series does not enforce any age or interval requirements. It is intended to validate a fourth dose of an IPV containing vaccine before the age of 4 years.\nFAQs\tWhy does the adult risk series have 3 doses when at risk individuals are recommended to have a single additional dose?\tAn adult with a history of complete vaccination does require only a single additional dose, however, per ACIP recommendations adults without documentation of a complete series should receive 3 doses.\thttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4905a1.htm\tDoses 1 and 2 of the adult risk series have Conditional Skip logic that allows the doses to be skipped if the patient has documented evidence of having completed the primary series already.\nFAQs\tWhich OPV formulations count towards completion of the polio recommendations?\tOnly documentation specifying receipt of trivalent vaccine (tOPV) constitutes proof of vaccination according to the U.S. polio vaccination recommendations\thttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6601a6.htm?s_cid=mm6601a6_e\tCVX 02 (tOPV) is the only OPV vaccine to count towards U.S. vaccination. tOPV is rarely used after 4/1/2016, but does count if it has been administered. At this time, tOPV is listed as an allowable vaccine to support cases when tOPV is actually administered. Proper documentation of which OPV vaccine was received is critical to validation of records against U.S. vaccination recommendations. With regards to CVX 89 (Polio Unspecified formulation) and CVX 182 (OPV Unspecified). Both of these can count towards U.S. vaccination if given before 4/1/2016, but not after.

Previously, the supporting data would recommend a dose at 7 AND at 11 in certain situations.

This is an unlikely scenario as administering ZVL after RZV is not a recommended administration pattern. The two intervals help ensure proper spacing for both evaluation and forecasting of RZV doses when ZVL is intermingled.
